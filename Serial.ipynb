    "x is $\\kappa$-sparse, i.e., in the simplest possible setting, that an\n",
    "orthonormal matrix $S$ exists (whose columns are the vectors\n",
    "of the sparsity basis) such that when we express $x=S\\xi$, then\n",
    "the vector $\\mathrm{\\xi = (\\xi_{1},...,\\xi_{n-1})}$ does not contain more than $\\kappa < n$ non-zero entries.\n",
    "The fact that $x$ depends only on a number of scalars that\n",
    "is less than its sheer dimensionality hints at the possibility\n",
    "of compressing it. CS does this by applying a linear operator\n",

    "matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R^{m\\times n}}$ with $m < n$ and defined in such a way that\n",
    "$x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$ can be retrieved from $y = \\mathcal{L_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)} \\in \\mathbb{R^m}$. The ratio\n",
    "$n/m$ is the compression ratio and will be indicated by CR.\n",
